            <h3>Hello, hello! My name is Kayla Ng and I am a Sophomore
                studying Computer Science at <span>Cornell University's College of
                    Engineering</span>.
                <br>
                <br>I first discovered my passion for Computer Science during my
                Freshman Year of High School when I took my first CS class ever: Intro to Visual Basic.
                Ever since, I have viewed programming as my creative outlet, a way for me to bring to
                life all of the ideas that are constantly bubbling in my brain. I love the challenge of
                coming up with successful algorithms and debugging. There is no greater feeling than seeing
                my code come to life.
                <br>
                <br>Outside of academics, I am a huge book reader/collector. In my free time, you can always find me
                reading a book or trying to find good deals
                at my favorite local used book stores. I also enjoy art and love to sketch and paint, specifically
                characters of my favorite shows which include
                Avatar the Last Airbender and One Piece. Moreover, I enjoy playing instruments and am a classically
                trained pianist of 10+ years.
                I also really love tea, coffee, and apple cider ( you can see me holding a jug of apple cider in my
                pictures above )!
