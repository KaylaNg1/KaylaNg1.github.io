                <h3>Hello, hello! My name is Kayla Ng and I am currently a Sophomore
                    studying Computer Science at <span>Cornell University's College of 
                    Engineering</span>.
                    <br>
                    <br>I first discovered my passion for Computer Science during my
                    Freshman Year of High School when I took my first CS class ever: Intro to Visual Basic.
                    Ever since, I have viewed programming as my creative outlet, a way for me to bring to 
                    life all of the ideas that are constantly bubbling in my brain. I love the challenge of
                    coming up with successful algorithms and debugging. There is no greater feeling than seeing 
                    my code come to life. 
                    <br>
                    <br>At my High School, the Computer Science department was small and limited in its coursework.
                    Moreover, at the beginning of my senior year, I had come to regret discovering CS so late. It would have been great if I had been exposed
                    to it earlier on such as through elementary or middle school. However, in my school district, CS was only
                    offered at the high school level. To spread CS and inspire more young students to pursue it, as well as make
                    the push for the expansion of the department, I participated 
                    in numerous outreach events as the President of my school's FRC robotics team. As a Senior and President of the 
                    Computer Science Honor Society, I created a now annual event called <span style = "font-weight: bolder;">CODE CON</span>, a Computer Science fair
                    hosted during CSEdWeek (CS Education Week) aimed at introducing the fields of CS to middle school students through
                    fun activites including but not limited to student made games, cryptography, robotics, and so much more!
                    <br>
                    <br>As a current Undergraduate, I joined <span>Cornell University Unmanned Air System's</span> (CUAIR) Autopilot Team, a software
                    subteam that aims to implement software to aid in autonomous flight planning, including managing the team's Autopilot Ground Station
                    and writing path planning algorithms. This past year as a Freshman, I had the absolute pleasure of working on an Airdrop Module with two of my peers
                    that aimed to generate 'Servo Waypoints' along our path plan for competition that would autonomously drop water bottles on to targets.
                    <br>
                    <br>Outside of academics, I am a huge book reader/collector. In my free time, you can always find me reading a book or trying to find good deals
                    at my favorite local used book stores. I also enjoy art and love to sketch and paint, specifically characters of my favorite shows which include 
                    Avatar the Last Airbender and One Piece. Moreover, I enjoy playing instruments and am a classically trained pianist of 10+ years. 
                    I also really love tea, coffee, and apple cider ( you can see me holding a jug of apple cider in my pictures above )!
